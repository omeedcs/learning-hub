## Learning Hub

Web application that was initially designed to serve as a side resource for students of CS312 (Introduction to Programming). Core features of the application are designed through Ruby on Rails. The website can be accessed through this link: https://bit.ly/3mlRYCz

After multiple Beta versions, this application had reached the first stage of deployment for students. But unfortunately, the logistics of it to actually deploy to UT Computer Science students was quite messy, so it never went into production. But, a lot of things were learned through the creation of this product, so feel free to hop on it, make an account, and enjoy!

FEATURES: 

1) Personalized Student Profile
2) Personalized Student Homepage
3) Engagement Point Tracker (represented through stars)
4) Public and Private Profile Management
5) Friend/Classmate Finder
6) Tab that directs you to a Office Hour Queue -> created by CS314 developers. 
7) Interactive Learning (never implemented, but intended as a khan academy style). 
8) Concept Wikis/Tutorials (forums developed, no concepts ever added, because no production).
9) Concept Posts (Organized by Communities) -> forums are multi-threaded and layered, but no production, so not much content added.
10) Post Engagement Ability (users can engage with posts by liking them and by commenting, all stored on database)

HOSTING: 

The hosting of this application is done through Heroku, a cloud application platform supporting several programming languages. This application does not contain any add-ons, but uses the SendGrid mail application to reroute emails to students after registration. The application is upgraded to use Hobby Development Dynos, but will be upgraded according to usage and scale. As of present day, there have been 100+ updates to GitHub, and about 55 deployments from GitHub to the heroku development branch, but of course, this number will increase as new features are added and new bugs are found.
